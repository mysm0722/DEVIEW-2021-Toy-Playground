"Summary\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's a genre of Korean pop music based on 4/4 beats.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n        Trot means \"walking fast\" and \"running with busy steps\" in English. The term has been solidified since 1914 in the U.S. and the U.K., when a social dance step or a rhythm of a jazz tempo, called a \"fox-trot,\" was popular in the U.S. and the U.K. However, in the West today, it remains only a social dance term, not a performance term.Korean trot is also based on this foxtrot. However, in the process of introducing and settling down trot, Korean trot experienced many ups and downs. Trot-style music was introduced in Korea from the late 1920s, Japanese colonial era. Earlier in Japan, Enka, which incorporated Western foxtrot into Japan's unique folk music, was popular.At the same time, new folk songs were popular in Korea, and as records began to be produced in earnest in 1928, many Japanese songs were translated into Korean, and many Japanese people were in charge of arranging Korean songs in the process of recording them in Japan. As a result, the melody of Japanese and Korean songs approached naturally, and from the late 1930s, Korean songs became more and more assimilated to Japanese songs due to the Joseon language extermination policy.As a result, Enka-style popular songs were popular in Korea until the liberation of Korea. After Korea's liberation from Japan's colonial rule, the production and distribution of self-reliant sound songs, pop songs and jazz techniques were introduced, and the so-called \"trot\" was also given a new name.However, the name \"Ppongjjak\" is not used in the music industry because it is a disparaging term. In Korea, trot music began to develop again in the 1960s, and by the 1970s, it was based on four-quarters of the beat of the foxtrot, but was completed in an independent K-pop format with a strong beat and a unique way of singing. The trot completed at this time is the current trot.There are mixed views in the music industry, such as viewing trot as Japanese music rooted in Japan's Enka and viewing it as independently developed music under the influence of Western Foxtrot."
