Overseas, it was called \"digital currency\" or \"virtual currency\" because it is invisible and expressed on computers at first, but recently, it is called \"cryptocurrency,\" meaning \"currency using encryption technology,\" and the government uses the term \"virtual currency.\" Cryptocurrency is valued according to the rules set by the first person who devised it, unlike ordinary currencies issued by governments and central banks. In addition, the government does not guarantee value or payment because the transaction details are not managed by the government or the central bank and are distributed based on blockchain technology. Cryptocurrency is handled in a distributed system that utilizes blockchain technology. People who participate in distributed systems are called miners, and they receive coin-type fees as compensation for blockchain processing. Because cryptocurrency is maintained with this structure, it does not cost any production costs due to the issuance of currency and can significantly reduce transaction costs such as transfer costs. It also has the advantage of having excellent functions as a means of value storage because it is stored on computer hard disks and does not cost storage costs and there is no fear of theft or loss. However, because the transaction's secrecy is guaranteed, it can be abused for drug transactions, gambling, and money laundering to raise slush funds, and it can be a tax evasion tool due to difficulties in taxation.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trepresentative cryptocurrencies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStarting with the development of Bitcoin in 2009, as many as 1,000 cryptocurrencies have been developed by 2017, and about 500 of them, half of them, are known to be traded. Representative cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Dash, Lightcoin, and Monero, which are currently leading the cryptocurrency market.  Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency developed by a programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto in January 2009. The total issuance is set at 21 million, but if the distribution exceeds a certain standard, the amount of mining at once decreases and the problem becomes difficult, which increases scarcity.It is a cryptocurrency developed in 2014 by Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian immigrant from Ethereum Russia.

(Look closely) · Lightcoin is a cryptocurrency developed by Charlie Lee on October 7, 2011, and easy mining is considered the biggest advantage. (Look closely) It was started under the name of Da Hongfei, CEO of Onchain, which received the Neo China national standard.(Looking closely) · Dash is a virtual currency developed in January 2014 that has a strong anonymity and can check real-time transfers. Originally released as Xcoin in January 2014, it was changed to Darkcoin in February, and officially renamed as Dashcoin on March 25, 2015. (See more) It is the second virtualization to be separated by Bitcoin Cash (BCH, BCC) in August 2017. Bitcoin gold was separated when the blockchain reached the 491407th block, resulting in a hard fork (chain separation). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlockchain technology, the core of cryptocurrency\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlockchain, a key technology in cryptocurrency, has drawn attention around the world as it was selected as one of the foundation technologies to lead the fourth industrial revolution in Davos Forum. Blockchain technology is a distributed bookkeeping database technology developed to record digital currency transactions such as Bitcoin, and is a trading system without a book manager in financial transactions. Whenever a new transaction occurs, the information is made into a separate block, and the block is connected to the existing account. Because distributed books are contrasted with each other every time a transaction occurs, it is extremely difficult to manipulate books, which can maintain strong security. However, it is difficult to cancel transactions made with blockchain, and there is a disadvantage that the responsibility in case of problems is ambiguous because there is no concept of a central institution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIFRS, cryptocurrency 'inventory and intangible assets, not monetary or financial assets'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Interpretations Committee of International Accounting Standards (IFRS) under the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASB) held a meeting in the UK from June 2019 to conclude that cryptocurrency cannot be classified as currency or financial assets. The Interpretations Committee of IFRS determined that some cryptocurrencies do not constitute cash in accounting, saying that 'they can be used as an exchange for goods and services, but not as a basis for recognising and measuring all transactions in financial statements as cash'. In addition, the entity does not have a contractual right to receive financial assets and therefore does not qualify for financial assets. In other words, cryptocurrency is not cash and it is not a financial product such as bank deposits, stocks, bonds, and insurance.  Instead, if cryptocurrency is held for sale or sold as an intermediary company in the usual business process, it is classified as inventory and all other assets are intangible assets. Inventory refers to goods, products, raw materials, etc. held for sale and intangible assets refer to non-monetary assets that have no physical substance but are identifiable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCryptocurrency references\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t · Cryptocurrency mining method, terms related to cryptocurrency, blockchain, cryptocurrency exchange"
