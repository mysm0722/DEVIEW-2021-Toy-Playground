"Summary\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a colorless and transparent gas that forms the lower atmosphere surrounding the Earth, created with the history of the Earth. It plays an essential role in the existence of life on Earth, and has been studied for a long time to reveal the composition of air.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t        \n            \n                \n                \n\n\n         \n             Large View of Image\n         \n    \n\n\n            Air\n\n    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n        Created with the history of the Earth, without air, the Earth's surface will be directly exposed to violent sunlight, solar heat, spacecraft, and cosmic dust, and there will be no carbon assimilation, nitrogen fixation, and breathing, making life impossible. In addition, sound is not propagated in space, it is impossible to burn objects, and there is no atmospheric pressure, rain, or wind.\nThe existence of air has long been recognized. Around 500 BC, Anaximenes of Greece advocated a one-sided theory called air, saying, \"Our souls are air, and as it dominates and maintains us, the world is surrounded by air and air.\" Empedokles and Aristotle also argued for the four-pronged theory of air.\nThe first person to reveal that air is matter and has weight is Galilee, and it is O who demonstrates that it plays an important role in sustaining our lives.Gerryke (1602–86). British physician J. Meio (1640–79), identified that the air was chemically active and other parts, called the air of fire.\nThis idea was followed by J. Priestley and K.W. Schellé and A.L. Lavoisier in 1774 to reveal that air was composed of oxygen and nitrogen. It was confirmed by H. Cavendish and Gay Lüsac that the composition of the air was constant, and by 1894 an inert gas in the air was discovered by J.W.S. Reilly and W.R. Ramsey."
