It continued to function as a central bank without any changes in its basic character or system, but was newly established in June 1950 when it was requested to establish a central bank with strong authority and political neutrality.The institution implements functions such as issuing currency and implementing monetary and credit policies, stabilizing financial systems, operating and managing banks, government banks, payment systems, holding and operating foreign currency assets, bank management analysis and inspection, economic surveys and statistics. \nThe main tasks are divided into general affairs, issuance, treasury affairs, and foreign exchange affairs. Among them are deposits and loans to general financial institutions, manipulation of the open market, and operation of monetary stabilization accounts, while issuing banknotes and coins as the only legalization issuing agency in Korea. The affairs of the treasury shall be the affairs of the supply and demand of treasury funds and the credit of the government, and the affairs of foreign exchange shall be the affairs of foreign exchange management and financial transactions. \nThe organization consists of the Monetary Policy Committee, which reviews and resolves key matters concerning monetary credit policy and the operation of the Bank of Korea, the president who serves as the chairman of the Monetary Policy Committee, and the Bank of Korea's audit. All members and auditors of the Monetary Policy Committee, including the president, are appointed by the president. \nAs of February 2015, it has three sub-organizations in 12 countries and audit offices, 16 regional headquarters in local metropolitan cities and provinces, and five overseas offices in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China."
