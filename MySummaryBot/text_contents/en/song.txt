"Summary\n\t\t\t\t\tA poem with a musicality and a good sense of music about poetry and literature.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n        In terms of music, it's supposed to be \"go\", \"no music\". \n\tWe distinguished it as \"yo\" and now it's all about folk songs. \n\tIt is commonly used as a term. Like this, K-pop is an art form of literature and music. \n\tIt combines literary and musical aspects.\n\t\n\tIn terms of music, it can be interpreted as a song with a broad meaning, but when it comes to music, \n\tIt is common to place some emphasis on literature, especially on history. K-pop is... \n\tFrom the primitive ages when poetry and music were not differentiated as art forms across literature and music. \n\tIt's already existed among ethnic groups, close to everyday life and religious events. \n\tHe had a relationship and was often tied down with dance or play.\n\nIt is one of the records of the Chinese literature on the life of the Korean people, namely, \"The Three Kingdoms\" and \"Wiji\" \n\tBuyeojeon, Koguryojeon, former, Hanhan, \n\tJinjeon Hall, Byunjinjeon Hall, and Dongjeon Hall of Hu Hanseo \n\tAccording to each tribal state, each tribe has its own custom. \n\tThe pattern of Jecheon, Sagwi, and Drought drinking appears. \n\tThere were rituals such as alliance, mucheon, and Yeonggo, among them instruments. \n\tThere is a record of the use of such a song as a comprehensive art at the time. \n\tIt can be seen that it already exists.\n\nIn the form of K-pop, the lyrics and the song were formed at the same time, and the poetry as the lyrics were composed. \n\tIt is divided into the composition and the lyrics attached to the song. \n\tIn the past, lyrics and songs were often made by the same writer. In that sense, \n\tK-pop is thought of as a form of poetry and, historically, as a source of poetry. \n\tIt is believed that the song has divided the poetry as a song that is read in the song as a song.\n\nAlso, K-pop is largely divided into folk and artistic songs, and folk songs are used to identify songwriters and composers. \n\tIt is characterized by difficult ethnic or collective production, and it is called the common people. \n\tTherefore, the lyrics and tune are simple. On the contrary, artistic music is a personal artistic creation. \n\tNot only is the lyricist and composer known, but the composition of the song is complicated, advanced, \n\tIt is usually sung by a professional singer.\n\t\n\tHowever, folk songs can also be the source of artistic songs, and artistic songs can be used in the lives of the people. \n\tSometimes it flows in and becomes like a folk song. If you look at K-pop in terms of its content, it's a very secular... \n\tIt can be divided into K-pop and religious songs. \n\tThere are annual song, labor song, celebration song, kwonju, lullaby, song, military song, march song, etc. \n\tReligious songs are made for rituals, worship, or sorcery, but in the West, they are meant to be gods. \n\tKorean hymns and hymns occupy an important place.\n\nKorean pop music is divided into the influences of Chinese poetry and Korean traditional pop music. \n\tThe incense burner of the Three Kingdoms Period was originally composed of folk songs and courts. \n\tByeolgok and sijo performed were developed. The folk song is \"Jeongeupsa\" from Baekje. \n\tThe Byeolgok is the oldest known by the Hanlim Byeolgok of the mid-Goryeo period \n\tIt was originated during the late Goryeo Period. These progenitors and their separations later became literary. \n\tIt became the standard for poetic justice."
