"It is the spatial and spiritual centripetal force of community composition, which means that the Divine Dansu is performing its functions. It goes without saying that the community of Sindansu partially overlaps with the globality. However, while cosmology is related to nature, community is a strong cultural sign as it is related to the establishment of political and social communities. Three signs of world sex, religion, and community are determined by the mythological or naturalistic attributes of the Sindansu, but they are also mythological and naturalistic archetypes formed by the Korean people's putting them on trees.        It is safe to say that the archetypal nature of Sindansu is projected on the wood painted in Jangheon's Goguryeo mural, the wood shaped like a 'leap' on the Silla crown, and the tree of the future generation of the seonang tree."
