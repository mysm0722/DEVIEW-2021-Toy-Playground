"Table of Contents Dust and Fine Dust\nthe composition of fine dust\n\nDust and fine dust\nDust is a particulate matter that floats or floats down in the atmosphere, which occurs frequently when fossil fuels such as coal, oil, etc. are burned or emitted from factories, cars, etc.\n\n\tDepending on the size of the particles, dust is classified into total dust (TSP) of 50 μm or less and fine dust (PM) of very small particle sizes (Particle Matter).\n\t\n\tFine dust is again divided into fine dust (PM10) with a diameter less than 10 μm and fine dust (PM2.5) with a diameter less than 2.5 μm.\n\t\n\tIf PM10 is about 1/5–1/7 smaller than the diameter of a human hair (50–70 μm), PM2.5 is only about 1/20–1/30 of the hair.\n\n\n\nComparison of fine dust size\n※ 1μm = 1/1000mm\n\nBecause fine dust is so small that it is invisible, it can have a bad effect on health by staying in the atmosphere and penetrating into the lungs through respiratory organs or moving into the body along blood vessels.1)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed air quality guidelines for fine dust (PM10, PM2.5) since 1987, and in 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) designated fine dust as the first group carcinogen (Group 1) confirmed to have cancer in humans.\nthe composition of fine dust\n\n\tThe components of fine dust may vary depending on the area, season, and weather conditions in which the fine dust occurred.\n\t\n\tIn general, it consists of lumps formed by air pollutants (sulfate, nitrate, etc.), carbon and soot generated during the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and minerals generated from earth dust on the ground.\n\n\n\nComposition of fine dust components (%)\n\n\n\tThe composition ratio of fine dust measured in six major regions across the country was the highest with 58.3% of air pollutant chunks (sulfate, nitrate, etc.), followed by carbon flow and soot with 16.8% and minerals with 6.3%.\n\t\n\tMeanwhile, the proportion of carbon and soot was relatively low in Baengnyeong Island, where the amount of fine dust generated in Korea was low.\n\n\n\nComposition of PM2.5 components by major regions"
