"Summary\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a stock market aimed at raising funds for promising small and medium-sized venture companies and has similar functions as the Nasdaq of the United States.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n        \n\tIt is a stock market for small and medium-sized venture companies that function similarly to the NASDAQ of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ).\n\n\n\tThe name is an English compilation of the NASDAQ (NASDAQ) of the United States, which was established on July 1, 1996 by the Securities Industry Association. The over-the-counter market, which remained in the preliminary stages of listing on the stock exchange due to the opening of the KOSDAQ, has served as an independent market on par with the stock exchange as a financing market and investment market like NASDAQ.\n\n\n\tIn the KOSDAQ market, stock trading is carried out with an electronic trading system that uses computers and telecommunications networks to trade over-the-counter stocks without buildings or floors for sale. Therefore, the KOSDAQ introduced a competitive trading method called participation of unspecified majority using electronic systems, providing an opportunity to reorganize the existing outdoor market.\n\n\n\tThe operation was initially handled by the Korea Securities Association's over-the-counter market management office, and in May 1996, the KOSDAQ Securities Market, a securities company in charge of stock brokerage, was established to delegate trading. In 1998, the KOSDAQ Committee, a decision-making body on market operation, was established within the Securities Industry Association to establish fairness and transparency in the operation of the KOSDAQ market.\n\n\n\tSince then, the KOSDAQ market's operating system was established in 2001 by specifying the basis and work of the KOSDAQ Committee in the Securities and Exchange Act. In January 2005, the KOSDAQ and KOSDAQ Commission were changed to the KOSDAQ Market Headquarters of the Korea Exchange when the Korea Exchange, KOSDAQ, Korea Futures Exchange, and KOSDAQ Commission were merged under the Korea Securities Exchange Act.\n\nAs it is incorporated into the market, it is said to be listed, just like the securities market, instead of the term registration. Usually, the securities market, which is equivalent to the old stock exchange market, is called the upper market of the integrated exchange and the KOSDAQ market are called the lower market. The listing standards tend to be eased rather than the securities market, which is characterized by many small and medium-sized companies and venture companies."
